$$ watch hook function watches the changes in a data point and runs a function when it changes..

$$ mounted() hook runs instantly when the application is mounted!

$$ data() returns the data we are going to be using in our App.vue main component

$$ methods() is for functions that we can call anytime

$$ computed is for listening to changes in our data so that it can update a variable in the instant that data is changed.. For example, when 
the data of user (name, lastname) changes, user's fullname automatically changes with the help of computed hook....
